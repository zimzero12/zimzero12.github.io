    <h1>Welcome to EchoDraw!</h1>
    <p>
        Hi! This is the instruction manual for EchoDraw, the programming language I made for you to learn and have fun with.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Use EchoDraw</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>On the left side of the screen, you'll see a list of code blocks.</li>
        <li>Drag the blocks you want into the big white space to build a program. They snap together like puzzle pieces!</li>
        <li>When you think your program is ready, click the big green <strong>"Run Program"</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Watch the right side of the screen to see a turtle draw what you programmed!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Blocks</h2>
    <p>These are the puzzle pieces you can use to give the computer instructions.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h3>The <span class="block-name">move forward</span> Block</h3>
        <p>This tells the turtle to move forward and draw a line. You can change the number to tell it how far to move.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h3>The <span class="block-name">turn right</span> Block</h3>
        <p>This tells the turtle to turn, but it stays in the same spot. You can change the number to tell it how many degrees to turn (90 is a perfect corner, like on a square).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h3>The <span class="block-name">repeat</span> Block</h3>
        <p>This is the most powerful block! Any blocks you put <strong>inside</strong> its C-shape will happen again and again. This is perfect for drawing shapes that have lots of the same sides.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Example Programs to Try</h2>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Challenge 1: Draw a Square</h3>
        <p>This is the best way to use the repeat block. A square has 4 sides and 4 corners, so we repeat the steps 4 times!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a <span class="block-name">repeat</span> block and make sure the number says 4.</li>
            <li>Inside it, put a <span class="block-name">move forward by 100</span> block.</li>
            <li>Under that, still inside the repeat, put a <span class="block-name">turn right by 90</span> block.</li>
            <li>Click "Run Program" and watch it go!</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Challenge 2: Draw a Star! (Hard)</h3>
        <p>Think you can make a star? The secret is in the angle you turn!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a <span class="block-name">repeat</span> block and set it to 5.</li>
            <li>Inside, use <span class="block-name">move forward by 150</span>.</li>
            <li>Then use <span class="block-name">turn right by 144</span>. (It's a weird number, but it works!)</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
